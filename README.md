Approximate quantum circuit compilation for proton-transfer kinetics on quantum processors.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* 
* 

### Installation

* 
* 

### Executing programme

* To run the main programme, make sure you have Python installed and the required dependencies set up (seethe Installation section). Then, to perform statevector simulations, execute qneo.py as
```
python qneo.py -m <method> -s <system> -a <approximation> -s <state>
```
* Additional arguments required for noisy simulations are specified within the script.
* To save custom noise models, execute save-noise-models.py as
```
python save-noise-models.py -y <year> -m <month> -d <day> -H <hour> -M <minutes> -S <seconds>
```
